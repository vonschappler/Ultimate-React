# Personal notes taken

## Section_01:

Creating a new and online environment to make a simple React Application:

 - Open the browser and type ``react.new`` in the address bar

React is structured into components. Each component is a function and the main component is usally named ``App``.
Those components always return a jsx output. JSX is a scripting format that allows returning both html and js on it.

Alongside components, React works with states and effects, which are used to update the page dynamically.
